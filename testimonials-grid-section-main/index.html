                                            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.

                                            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent

  100% recommend! ”
