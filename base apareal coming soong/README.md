## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

Emphasis is placed on the use of html forms for data capture by the user.

Split design features.


### Continued development

The page is designed for "1444" and "375" screen ratios, but not for the other views. So I would like to improve the fully responsive design in the future.


### Useful resources

- [Selector js](https://www.example.com) - As one of my first projects it was important to understand the dynamics of selectors.
